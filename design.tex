\section{Introduction}

This document outlines the design and development process of the cr\^epe game engine,
detailing the key decisions made during its creation. The primary goal of this engine
is to offer a streamlined, Unity-like experience tailored for developing 2D games
similar to Jetpack Joyride.

The cr\^epe engine is designed to ease the transition for developers familiar with
Unity, ensuring minimal friction when switching platforms. Our aim is to preserve
many of Unityâ€™s core features while introducing a lightweight and open-source
alternative, licensed under the MIT License.

The engine is primarily aimed at indie developers who have prior experience with
Unity and are looking for a flexible, cost-effective solution with familiar
workflows.
