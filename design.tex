\section{Introduction}

This document outlines the design and development process of the cr\^epe game engine,
detailing the key decisions made during its creation. The primary goal of this engine
is to offer a streamlined, Unity-like experience tailored for developing 2D games
similar to Jetpack Joyride.

The cr\^epe engine is designed to ease the transition for developers familiar with
Unity, ensuring minimal friction when switching platforms. Our aim is to preserve
many of Unityâ€™s core features while introducing a lightweight and open-source
alternative, licensed under the MIT License.

The engine is primarily aimed at indie developers who have prior experience with
Unity and are looking for a flexible, cost-effective solution with familiar
workflows.

\subsubsection{Fa\c{c}ade}

\Cref{fig:class-audio-facade} shows a class diagram of the audio fa\c{c}ade. It
contains the following classes:
\begin{description}
	\item[SoundSystem] This is a wrapper around the \codeinline{SoLoud::soloud}
		`engine' class, and is therefore implemented as a singleton. This ensures the
		audio engine is initialized before \codeinline{Sound} is able to use it.

		This class is friends with \codeinline{Sound}, so only \codeinline{Sound} is able
		to get the \codeinline{SoundSystem} instance.
	\item[Sound] This is a wrapper around the \codeinline{SoLoud::Wav} class, and uses
		cr\^epe's \codeinline{api::Resource} class to load an audio sample instead.
