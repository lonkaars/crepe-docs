\section{Introduction} This document outlines the design and development process of the Crepe Game Engine, detailing the key decisions made during its creation. The primary goal of this engine is to offer a streamlined, Unity-like experience tailored for developing 2D games similar to Jetpack Joyride.

The Crepe Engine is designed to ease the transition for developers familiar with Unity, ensuring minimal friction when switching platforms. Our aim is to preserve many of Unityâ€™s core features while introducing a lightweight and open-source alternative, licensed under the MIT License.

The engine is primarily aimed at indie developers who have prior experience with Unity and are looking for a flexible, cost-effective solution with familiar workflows.
