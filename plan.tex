\section{Git Workflow}

GitHub is used for version management of both code and documentation, each in its own respective repository.
This keep the documentation and code seperate, resulting in ordened and manageable repositories. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code Repository: \href{https://github.com/lonkaars/crepe}{crepe}
    \item Documentation Repository: \href{https://github.com/lonkaars/crepe-docs}{crepe-docs}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project roles}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Loek Le Blansch}: Integrator
    \item \textbf{Wouter Boerenkamps}: Project Member
    \item \textbf{Jaro Rutjes}: Team Leader / Scrum Master
    \item \textbf{Max Smits}: Project Member
    \item \textbf{Niels Stunnebrink}: Project Member
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Work hours}
Each project member will keep track of their own working hours and 
add them to the 'file'.

\subsection{Absents}
If a project member is going to be absent, they are required to notify the 
team through either WhatsApp or Outlook. Additionally, the teacher should 
be informed of the absence as well.

\subsection{Inconsistent Participation}
Inconsistent participation will be addressed in a structured manner:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initial Discussion}: The team leader will first discuss the 
    issue of inconsistent participation with the individual team member.
    \item \textbf{Team Discussion}: If no improvement is observed, the issue 
    will be brought up with the entire team to seek a collective solution.
    \item \textbf{Project Supervisor Involvement}: Should the problem persist 
    despite these efforts, it will be escalated to the project supervisor for 
    further action.
\end{enumerate}

Valid reasons for absence or inconsistency will be considered, and no 
repercussions will be necessary in such cases. However, if the inconsistency 
is due to other factors, potential repercussions may include additional 
assignments or actions as determined by the project supervisor.

A team member is considered to have inconsistent participation if their hours 
are significantly behind the teamâ€™s average or if tasks are not completed 
without valid reasons. It is essential that any concerns regarding a team 
member's performance be resolved through unanimous agreement within the team.


\subsection{Weekly update}
Each team member is required to send their technical weekly update to Jaro 
Rutjes before 12:00 on Friday. Personal updates may also be included and will be kept 
confidential between the team member, the Team Leader, and/or the teacher, 
if requested.

Jaro Rutjes will compile and send a team update to the project supervisor,
Bob van der Putten, also by Friday. This update will include technical 
information on what has been accomplished, plans for upcoming work, and an 
overview of the team's overall progress.
