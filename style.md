## Comma And

**In lists**, the last element is mentioned using the word 'and', *without* a
comma.

**When joining independent clauses**, keep a comma before the word 'and'.
Usually, this comma can be left out for short clauses, but we keep them in for
consistency.

**Good examples:**

> The first, second and last items.
>
> Action X was performed, and this had Y impact.

# Figures

Non-raster figures are preferred over rasterized figures (where applicable).
Please note that LaTeX does not support SVG images, and these need to be
converted to PDF (e.g. using `svg2pdf` on linux).

Raster images should only be used when the source is already in a raster format
(e.g. for photos) or when otherwise impractical.
