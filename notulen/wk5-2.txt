	Research (POC)
		research eventmanager -> Wouter POC
		resource manager -> Niels POC check datatype for conversion
		start research savedata
		start research renderer
		start research scripting
		[closed] start research debugging
		[closed] start research gameobject
		start research physics Starting POC -> Jaro
			[closed] Discussed functional physics requirements
			More research about physics
		research ecs -> Max POC(showed poc design must change asked customer if design can change)
		start research particles Starting research -> Jaro (LOEK is sterk tegen particles in physics system omdat loek geen vloeistof wilt)
	Design
		discussed class diagram
			one instance of rigidbody and collider
			Gameobject is not the owner of the component but the manager is
			and one component type per gameobject.
			Functions within a model can they change?
		[closed] Adding design audio
		Adding design resource manager -> niels met LOEK overleggen
		Adding design gameloop + eventmanager -> Wouter toevoegen
		Discuss facade design.
		Who is owner of which facade instancies?
		How does a game designer make a scene?
		resourceManager discuss design.
	Product
		Creating 3rd party tool facade audio -> LOEK verder werken
		Api	class diagram to c++ will wait until some design changes
	Test
		Add unit test for audio (wait on api)
		Discuss about what to test (wait on api)
	Question Bob
		Mail (waiting on mail for KD)
		Tell where these documents are located -> jaro
