	Research (POC)
		research eventmanager -> Wouter POC (goede voortgang)
		resource manager -> Niels POC check datatype for conversion (na meeting afgerond) alleen implementatie tiled
		start research ui -> wouter
		start research ai
		start research savedata -> loek
		start research renderer -> niels (kleine start)
		start research scripting -> loek
		start research debugging (los staande profilers, toevoegen timers voor profilers?)
		start research physics Starting POC -> Jaro
			More research about physics
			Question customer about physics requirements
		start reasearch collsion detection -> Jaro
		research ecs -> Max POC
		start research particles Starting research -> Jaro (LOEK is sterk tegen particles in physics system omdat loek geen vloeistof wilt)
	Design
		[closed] discussed class diagram
			one instance of rigidbody and collider
			Gameobject is not the owner of the component but the manager is
			and one component type per gameobject.
			Functions within a model can they change
		Adding design asset class -> niels
		Adding design resource holder -> niels 
		[closed] Adding design gameloop  -> Wouter toevoegen
		Discuss facade design.
		Who is owner of which facade instancies?
		who is owner of what?
		How does a game designer make a scene?
		[closed] resourceManager discuss design.
		review design document (loeks features) -> Wouter
	Product
		[closed] Creating 3rd party tool facade audio -> LOEK verder werken
		Api	class diagram to c++
	Test
		Add unit test for audio (do we want unit tests)
		Discuss about what to test (wait on api)
		Change location tests -> loek
	Question Bob
		Tell where these documents are located -> jaro
		Question customer about physics requirements
		functions in components (setter)
		We ondersteunen toetsenbord en muis.
